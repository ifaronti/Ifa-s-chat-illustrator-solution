## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned the concept of pseudo elements and how to use them to create different shapes in CSS.

### Continued development

I'll be more focused on my css. My problems with CSS often get solved but I want to internalize most of the fundamentals so I don't have to google some of the simplest challenges in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com) - I was having issues with my box-shadow property so I revisited some helpful articles on the site to refresh my memory on the topic.
