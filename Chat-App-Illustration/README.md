## My process

The process for this was simpler as it's just CSS and HTML. So, the first thing I did was group all the content of the illustration by proximity to each other and position on the illustration. The two background gradients were designed first then the UI-frame and its content. then I designed the main heading and the paragraph below the heading. The UI required a lot of attention to details so I took my time with every aspect of its contents. The right-chat's box-shadow can go unnoticed but I figured it out by using color-picker to ensure I'm not missing anything.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned
I learned the concept of pseudo elements and how to use them to create different shapes in CSS.

### Continued development

I'll be more focused on my css. My problems with CSS often get solved but I want to internalize most of the fundamentals so I don't have to google some of the simplest challenges in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com) - I was having issues with my box-shadow property so I revisited some helpful articles on the site to refresh my memory on the topic.
